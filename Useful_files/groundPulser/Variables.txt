File anitaII_ground_pulser.root

For each logged ground pulser event the following information is saved:

All variables are branches on the tree "gp_log" of anitaII_ground_pulser.root file.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

gps_time : Time of the most recent GPS update in seconds since midnight UTC.

gps_lat  : The last known latitude in degrees of the payload.

gps_lon  : The last known longitude in degrees of the payload.

gps_surface_dist : Distance to the payload from surface antenna calculated using the last known payload location.

gps_borehole_dist : Distance to the payload from borehole antenna calculated using the last known payload location.


fit_time : The time for which the payload's position 
	   was be extrapolated. In UNIX epoch seconds.

surface_fit : The extrapolated distance in meters from the surface antenna to the 
	    payload at fit_time.

borehole_fit: The extrapolated distance in meters from the borehole antenna to the 
	    payload at fit_time.

elevation_fit : The extrapolated elevation in degrees of the payload above the horizon at fit_time.

azimuth : The extrapolated azimuth in degrees of the payload above the horizon at fit_time.

trigger_time : Time of the delay generator trigger recorded by the system. In UNIX seconds.
	The delay generator is always triggered on PPS, but system records time about 10-100 ms later
	due to delays in router and such.


sg_freq : -1 if the impulse was sent, frequency of the tone bursts sent otherwise.

sg_level : The amplitude in mV set fot the CW generator for the tone bursts. Not necessary related to the CW generator
	output and has nothing to do with amplitude at the surface antenna output. 


surface_attenuation : dB's attenuation set for the surface antenna.

antenna : The polarization of the signal of the surface antenna.
    
     antenna = -1 : Seavey turned off.
     antenna = 0  : Horizontal polarization.
     antenna = 1  : Vertical polarization.
     antenna = 3  : Seavey sending pulses at 45 degree polarization.
     antenna = 13 : Seavey sending pulses at 45 degree polarization, but manual log
	indicates problems with telemetry updates. Data might be unreliable.

surface_dither : Additional offset (in ns) applied to the time at which the 
	       surface signal is sent. Negative means the signal is sent earlier than calcuilated.

surface_t_delay : Time delay programmed into the surface antenna delay generator in sec. The signal should leave the surface
	antenna 258 ns later.

borehole_dither: Additional offset (in ns) applied to the time at which the 
	       borehole signal is sent. Negative means the signal is sent earlier than calcuilated.

borehole_t_delay : Time delay programmed into the borehole antenna delay generator in sec. The signal should leave the borehole
	antenna 775 ns later.

borehole_attenuation : attenuation (in dB) on the borehole pulser.

borehole_pulses_per_second : Number of borehole pulses sent per second.
			   borehole_pulses_per_second = 0: No borehole pulses are sent
			   borehole_pulses_per_second = 4: Pulsing on
			   the 150 ms, 350 ms, 550 ms and 750 ms. The signal will
			   arrive to the borehole antenna 775 ns after
			   the delay generator is triggered.
			   borehole_pulses_per_second = 14: same as 4, but indicates some problems
			   with telemetry update at the biginning of the flight
			   borehole_pulses_per_second = 24: same as 4, but indicates periods when LOS communication
			   was not reliable.

borehole_transmission_type :  3 = 6kV FID pulser

gps_age : time in sec since last telemetry update.


There are some manually applied corrections to the ground pulser log. Mainly the transmission modes, so the times can be off by about a 
minute or so. Borehole attenuation was always charnged manually. There are very few pulses sent, but not logged.


The ROOT file is indexed by trig_time variable. An entry for the ground pulser can be retrieved by UNIX time. If there is no
entry present, the ground pulser system was off.


Files BHEvents.txt, Seavey45Events.txt, SeaveyHEvents.txt and SeaveyVEvents.txt contain event numbers from ANITA II data stream that
corresponds to the ground pulser events. Those are the events that triggered the payload (RF or PPS2) within 100 ns time window of 
predetermined time taking into account a distance error calculated after the flight. These files can be used for the ground pulser
data analysis or to cut off the ground pulser events.
